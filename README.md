# BikeExpressSite
Built in 2019 for my Interactive Web Development class.

A proof of concept site for understanding Express and Node.

Features include:
* connection to a local MongoDB server
* pages developed using PUG and reading from JSON files
* routing in JavaScript

Very rough and unfinished, current commits are outdated as this repository was made in 2022
